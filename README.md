- What is Docker
*Docker originally used LinuX Containers (LXC), but later switched to runC (formerly known as libcontainer), which runs in the same operating system as its host.
* With Docker you get less isolation, but the containers are lightweight (require fewer resources). So you could easily run thousands of containers on a host
